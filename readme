This is for bootstrapping the arogcd instance, and the configuration.
You must be logged into the cluster first using oc login before executing these shell scripts.
The way the kustomize files are written this whole directory could be moved to seperate repostiroy, but is keep here for ease of reference.

/config     Folder contains kustomize files that load the argocd configuration
/operator   Folder contains kustomize files that load the argocd operator

The following shell scripts handle the operator subscription, wait on its installation, then load the appropriate cluster argocd configuration
- dev.sh
- test.sh
